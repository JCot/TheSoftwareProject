This is the list of assumptions that we are making for the implementation
of the software project day.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- An employee asking a question is still considered to be working (unless they
    are waiting for the project manager) and will not leave for lunch while
    asking a question or waiting for one to be answered.
- Everyone is finished with lunch by 4pm.
- Assume parameters can be used for arrival and lunch times
  - Default is a random times for arrival time, lunch start
    and lunch length (between 30 - 60 minutes though) 
  - End time can be determined with these parameters
