This is the list of assumptions that we are making for the implementation
of the software project day.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Arrival time is strictly between 8 and 8:30am but employees can arrive at a random
  time between that interval

- Time at lunch is also strictly between 30 minutes and 1 hour, but each employee can have a different
  amount of lunch time and different lunch times.

- Everyone is finished with lunch between 12pm and 4pm unless a developer had a late lunch due to someone asking a question.
  In that case the developer will go to lunch ASAP and will return to work no later than
  4:15pm so that they can  still be on time for the status meeting.

- The time between 4pm and 4:15pm is reserved as the time to finish answering questions and wait for people to get back from late
  lunches. Otherwise, developers with no questions and at work will go to the status meeting at 4pm.

- Employees will always leave when they have worked eight hours and will not work overtime.

- An employee asking a question is still considered to be working (even if they
    are waiting) and will not leave for lunch while
    asking a question or waiting for one to be answered.

- Developers and team leads will only ask one question at a time and wait for that question to be answered before
  they ask the next question.

- Team leads and the manager all have a queue in which they address questions and can receive questions in their
  queues even if they are not available at the moment the question was answered

- Any questions asked to a team lead or the manager past 4pm are requested to be put off until the next work day
  so that the status meeting is not held up.

- Developers do not ask questions before their standup meeting and do not ask questions after the status meeting
  so that they can start/wrap up work.

- Parameters to be used in the program
  - Number of Teams: default is 3
  - Number of Developers per team: default is 4
  - Number of Questions asked during the day
      Team Leads: default is either 0 questions or 1 question (since they are experienced)
      Developers: defualt is between 1 question and 2 questions (due to the lack of experience)
  - Number of Conference Rooms: default is 1
