This is the list of assumptions that we are making for the implementation
of the software project day.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- An employee asking a question is still considered to be working (unless they
    are waiting for the project manager) and will not leave for lunch while
    asking a question or waiting for one to be answered.
- Everyone is finished with lunch by 4pm.
- Assume parameters can be used for arrival and lunch times
  - Default is a random time for arrival time (between 8 and 8:30am), 
    lunch end time (between 12pm and 4pm)
    and lunch length (between 30 - 60 minutes)
  - The lunch start time and end of workday time can be determined with these parameters
