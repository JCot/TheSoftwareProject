Report Outline
-------------------------------
You should make and document plausible assumptions:
	- about the time between questions for a team
	- average lunch break
	- arrival and departure times

Experiment with different assumptions to see their effect, and document the results. 

Write a report that details your design 
	- decisions related to concurrency
	- use of data structures
	- special synchronization
	- alternatives you considered

The results of your experiments (e.g., were any race conditions uncovered? were you able to correct these?).
