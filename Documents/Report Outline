Report Outline
-------------------------------
You should make and document plausible assumptions: (see Project Assumptions)
	- about the time between questions for a team
	- average lunch break
	- arrival and departure times

Experiment with different assumptions to see their effect, and document the results. 

Write a report that details your design 
	- decisions related to concurrency
	- use of data structures
		- Abstract Worker class -> implements Template Method design pattern w/ Workday method
		- Clock class for keeping track of time (its a SMR)
		- Queue for the questions
		- MeetingController class to encapsulate meeting latches/barriers
	- special synchronization
		- keeping the conference rooms open
		- boolean values for if a worker is "busy" or "free"
	- alternatives you considered
		- can talk a bit about alternate assumptions
		- Class/Thread for the Conference room
		- Use of a single thread (and no SMR) for keeping track of time
	- implementation challenges
		- can talk about these as well

The results of your experiments (e.g., were any race conditions uncovered? were you able to correct these?).
	Possible experiments
		- Raising/lowering the number of questions each employee asks
		- Change the waiting for a question to be answered from working-time to just sitting there and waiting time
